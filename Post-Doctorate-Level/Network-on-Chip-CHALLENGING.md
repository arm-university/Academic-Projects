### Project Difficulty
Challenging
**Audience:** Electronic Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to create an FPGA prototyping platform for a multi-core system with a Network-On-Chip (NoC) bus fabric. The main deliverables include designing and implementing a multi-core heterogeneous SoC, integrating the NoC bus fabric, and prototyping the system on an FPGA. This project will provide practical experience in SoC design, FPGA prototyping, and NoC architecture. The final output will be a functional FPGA prototyping platform that demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the multi-core system with NoC.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 6 months to 1 year to complete, involving a team of 4-5 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: Vivado, ModelSim, NoC design tools
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), NoC components
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on SoC design, FPGA prototyping, and NoC architecture
- Textbooks: "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by David Harris and Sarah Harris
