### Project Difficulty
Challenging
**Audience:** Computer Science (CS) / Electronic Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to create a dashboard to manage the configuration and execution of multiple ARM Fixed Virtual Platform (VP) instances. The focus is on scaling development efforts, optimizing new development processes, and methodologies. Students will enhance their skills in system management, automation, and data visualization, contributing to more efficient and scalable development workflows. The main deliverable is a functional dashboard that provides an intuitive interface for managing multiple VP instances, optimizing their configuration, and monitoring their execution.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 8-12 weeks to complete, involving a team of 3-4 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, JavaScript
- Tooling: Flask/Django for the backend, D3.js for data visualization
- Hardware: Access to a computer with internet connectivity
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)
