### Project Difficulty
Challenging
**Audience:** Electrical Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to collaborate across multiple universities as part of SoC labs to build an A-class SoC that can support a full operating system, using Cortex-A53. The main objective is to develop core capabilities around establishing the critical boot system. This project will provide practical experience in SoC design, operating system integration, and boot system development. The final output will be a functional SoC platform capable of running a full operating system, demonstrating the feasibility and performance of the design.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 6 months to 1 year to complete, involving a team of 4-5 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: Vivado, ModelSim, operating system development tools
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), Cortex-A53 CPU
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on SoC design, operating system integration, and boot system development
