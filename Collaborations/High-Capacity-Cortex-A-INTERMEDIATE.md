### Project Difficulty
Challenging
**Audience:** Electrical Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to collaborate across multiple universities as part of SoC labs on designing and implementing a high capacity memory subsystem for A series CPU based SoCs. The main deliverables include the design and implementation of a memory subsystem that can handle high capacity and ensure efficient data transfer and storage. This project will provide practical experience in memory subsystem design, SoC architecture, and Cortex-A series CPU design. The final output will be a functional high capacity memory subsystem integrated with a Cortex-A based SoC.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 6-12 months to complete, involving a team of 4-5 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: Vivado, ModelSim, memory design tools
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), Cortex-A series CPU
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on memory subsystem design, SoC architecture, and Cortex-A series CPU design
