# Develop a cocotb Test Bench to Correctly Configure and Operate the Arm PL022 Serial Port [BE]
![supporting image]()

### Project Difficulty
Intermediate
**Audience:** Electronic Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to collaborate on developing a cocotb test bench to ensure the correct configuration for synchronous serial communication with peripheral devices using the Arm PL022 Serial Port. The main objective is to make it possible to copy code instructions into the SoC RAM. This project will provide practical experience in test bench development, serial communication, and SoC configuration. The final output will be a functional cocotb test bench that ensures the correct operation of the Arm PL022 Serial Port.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 6-8 weeks to complete, involving a team of 2-3 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: cocotb, ModelSim, Vivado
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), Arm PL022 Serial Port
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)
